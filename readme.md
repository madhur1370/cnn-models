This repository have basic convolutional models like resnet-50,vgg19 

these models can be directly use for image classification problem in  deep learning

For building the image classification model you need to know function or methods that can help you building the theoratical model
like for convolution layer use nn.conv2d(2-d data),nn.Linear for linear layer and some other functions (relu,leakyrelu,selu,batchnorm,softmax,crossentropy)

You need to know some builtin  methods of pytorch to make models not master the pytorch like data preparation methods,optimizers,losses(nn.crossentropyloss)
